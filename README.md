LLM Project - Building a News Research Tool

[app link](https://project-9-llm.streamlit.app/)

This project is a tool for summarizing news articles using OpenAI's language models.


Prerequisites

Before running the project, we need to ensure that we have the following dependencies installed: Python (version 3.6 or higher), Streamlit (pip install streamlit), langchain, openai, newsapi. We need to make Openai API Key and NewsAPI Key.

Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

|--app1.py

|--langchain_config.py

|--requirements.txt

|--.streamlit

| |--secrets.toml

|--README.md

|--LLM.pdf

I have stored Openai API key and NewsAPI key in secrets.toml file so that it can be safe and no one can leak it.


Running the Web App

Navigate to the app/directory and it can be run by running the:

langchain_config.py(python file) by giving the command "python langchain_config.py" 

and then

app1.py(python file) by giving the command "streamlit run app1.py"
